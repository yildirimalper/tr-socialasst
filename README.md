**Title:** Political Economy of Social Assistance in the Justice and Development Party (AKP) Era

**Abstract:**
In February 2001, Turkey had experienced a severe economic crisis that had wide-scale impacts on the Turkish economy, such as income distribution, banking sector, and the declines in output and unemployment. After the crisis, the Turkish economy had faced a neoliberal restructuring through the EU membership process and the IMF program. On the other hand, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came into power in 2002 and has been the governing party since then. Therefore, in the neoliberal restructuring process of Turkey, AKP was the governing party and thusly the party executed economic and social transformations. One important aspect of that transformation is the changes in social assistance programs, since AKP paid attention to the social assistance and reformed certain aspects of the social security system. This paper aims to examine the changes of social assistance system during the AKP rule from a political economy perspective and to mark certain historical breakdown in social assistance using quantitative data provided by the World Bank API. The most striking finding of this research is the changing attitude in social assistance in Turkey after 2008 Global Financial Crisis regarding the urban/rural distributions of social assistance and the average per capita shares of different income quantiles from the social assistance.
